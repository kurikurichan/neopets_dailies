## The current version of this app does not work because I was trying to configure it to work with Docker and automatically install the correct versions of Chromedriver and run on it. The reason I uploaded it is for demonstration purposes

Hello and welcome to the Neopets Dailies Bot!

This bot requires Google Chrome to run (I may make it responsive to other browsers at some point).
Make sure that you have logged into Neopets recently and you do not need to input your birthdate (which happens if you haven't played in a while).

To get started, input your Neopets username(s) and password(s) into the login.py file.

Make sure to have Chrome, and Chrome's Selenium Webdriver installed on your computer. Chromedriver's version must match the version of Chrome you have installed.

To run this program, run ```python main.py``` in the neopets_bot_py directory.

It should work!
